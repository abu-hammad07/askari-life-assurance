                <div class="detail mb-5">
                    Under this Riders if the group life insurance contract is for at least three years or renewed consecutively for three years, then we will share the profits of the policy during the three years profit-sharing period as per the following formula:
                    Total premium received by Askari Life during the profit sharing period of three years
                    Less expense allowance for Askari Life (certain percent of (a))
                    Less claims paid or payable including provision for claims that may have incurred by the end of the profit sharing period but not reported
                    <br /><br />
                    The profit, if any, for the 3 year period will be equal to a-(b+c). If this amount is positive then we have a profit during the 3 year period. Certain percentage of this amount will be payable to the assured and adjusted accordingly from the premium payable in the first year of the subsequent profit sharing period of 3 years. This calculation will be done on a 3 year accumulated basis only and is available to clients whose average number of employees stays above 500 over the 3 year profit sharing period .
                    However, in case there is a loss accordingly to the above formula, the loss figure maybe carried over to the subsequent profit sharing period(s) until the loss is eliminated. Furthermore, the actual percentage of profit payable to the client will vary with the size of the group.

                    In addition to providing lump sum death benefit to the dependents of a deceased employee, a regular income to the family can also be arranged. Lump sum payments take care of the immediate needs of a bereaved family.
                    After paying for various obligations not much is left for the day-to-day necessities of the family. To cater for such a situation, additional cover may be obtained for the whole group economically. As the needs of each group may vary, the actual plan will be worked out after determining the exact requirements of the Group.
