                        Sometimes, we get so occupied with simply carrying on with the
                        standard life and becoming acclimated to it that vulnerabilities are
                        frequently overlooked. Notwithstanding this, we actually want to give
                        the best life to our loved ones and consequently, plan our future in the
                        most ideal way. The ongoing worldwide pandemic being Covid-19 that
                        shook the world recently was a shocker for some as it made individuals
                        value life much more. Life became more precious while relationships
                        strengthened more than ever.
