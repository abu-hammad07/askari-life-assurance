                                            It’s an unfortunate fact that the money we have is worth a little less every
                                            day.
                                            As rising inflation erodes all our savings bit by bit, we need a plan to
                                            keep our
                                            savings intact. Askari Nayab plan offers this unique feature dedicated to
                                            combat
                                            inflation with just 5% increment in the premium every year
