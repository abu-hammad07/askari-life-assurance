                        Sometimes we take life and the blessings that come with it for granted.
                        We get so busy with just living the routine life and getting used to it
                        that uncertainties are often ignored. Despite all this, we still desire to
                        give the finest life to our loved ones and thus, plan our future in the
                        best possible way. However, sometimes life gets unpredictable and
                        pursuing our dreams while leading a stress free life, seems a little
                        far-fetched. The recent global pandemic being COVID-19 that shook
                        the world lately was an eye opener for many as it made people value
                        life even more. Life became more precious while relationships
                        strengthened more than ever.
